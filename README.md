# RedBot

My personal RedditBot.

## What this Reddit Bot does?

1. Reads the specified one or more subreddits for new submissions.
2. If a submission meets the criteria it will pop open that submission link in the default browser.
3. Instead of popping up the submission they can also be displayed in form of push notifications.
